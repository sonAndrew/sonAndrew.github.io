**Hi, Kon'ichiwa, Hola, Marhabaan**

My name is Andrew but you can call me **Sunny**. 
I am an aspiring Web Developer and UI Designer with some System Administation and White Hat sprinkled in.
I have been learning and trying to find that first position as a Web Developer/Designer for about *2 years* now and learning for *3*.
I enjoy learning and working with technology both hardware and software. I love this time we live in where technology is
advancing so much that it looks like one of the Anime I watched as a kid. I also love watching Syfy shows like TWD and The 100.
My favorite games to play are Destiny 2, any Monster Hunter game from U4 up, and The Division 2. If you enjoy even one of the things I do we should connect.
